# assignment_files

csv files for my python assignments, usually cleaned up versions of already available open data released under the [Open Government License for pupblic sector infornation (UK)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) and shared here under the same license. Feel free to use but do include the link back to the Open Government License if you do.
